#TF-IDF Project
This project implements TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a widely used technique in text mining and natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate the importance of a word in a collection of documents (corpus).

##Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a clear and modular implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm, which can be used to preprocess textual data for various NLP tasks like document classification, clustering, search engine indexing, and information retrieval.

TF-IDF quantifies the relevance of a term within a specific document relative to its occurrence in a larger corpus. The underlying idea is:

Term Frequency (TF) measures how frequently a word appears in a document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) downscales terms that appear across many documents, as such words are likely less important.
Core Features:
Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stop word removal, and optional stemming or lemmatization.
TF-IDF Calculation: Efficient implementation of TF, IDF, and TF-IDF scores for a given corpus.
Document Similarity: Ability to compute cosine similarity between documents based on their TF-IDF vectors.
Modular Design: The code is designed to be easily extended and customized.
